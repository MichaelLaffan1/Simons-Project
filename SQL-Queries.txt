These are the SQL queries I would have implemented

Number of restaurants in Manhattan that have B or better grade:
SELECT COUNT(CAMIS)
FROM NYCRestaurants
WHERE BORO = "Manhattan"
AND GRADE <= 'B';

The average score of Pizza restaurants in Queens:
SELECT AVG(SCORE)
FROM NYCRestaurants
WHERE BORO = "Queens"
AND CUISINE_DESCRIPTION = "Pizza";

List all the unique restaurant names in zip code 10010 that have a grade A
in alphabetical order:
SELECT DBA
FROM NYCRestaurants
WHERE ZIPCODE = 10010
AND GRADE = "A"
ORDER BY DBA ASC;

Unique Query:
List the zipcodes and the names of the restaurants that had no violations listed:
SELECT DBA, ZIPCODE
FROM NYCRestaurants
WHERE VIOLATION_CODE = NULL;
